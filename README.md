# Bike Share Membership Analysis

![banner](Visuals/banner.png)

## Overview

For this case study, a bike-share company in Chicago by the name of Cyclistic wants to utilize the skills of the marketing analyst team by designing a new market strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, it is up to me to help the team understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Before we put out a new marketing strategy, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Business Understanding

Until now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

The director of marketing believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, she believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members.

Business objective will be to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. The marketing director and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Guided Questions

These three questions will help guide the future marketing program:

1.  How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

2.  Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual membership?

3.  How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Data Understanding & Limitations

All data used for this analysis comes from the company's internal historical data. The data collected reflects the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data prior to the start of the case study. (Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).)

Data-privacy issues prohibit me from using riders' personally identifiable information. This means that I won't be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
