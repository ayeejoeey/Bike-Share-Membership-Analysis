## Overview

For this case study, a bike-share company in Chicago by the name of Cyclistic wants to utilize the skills of the marketing analyst team by designing a new market strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, it is up to me to help the team understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Before we put out a new marketing strategy, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
